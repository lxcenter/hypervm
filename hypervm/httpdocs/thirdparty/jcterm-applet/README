How To Try
==========
This archive does not include java byte code, so please compile
the source code by your self.  Suppose you have jsch-?.?.?.zip. 

  $ unzip jcterm-?.?.?.zip
  $ cd jcterm-?.?.?/
  $ mkdir lib/
  $ (cd lib; \
     wget \
       http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsch/files/jsch.jar/0.1.48/jsch-0.1.48.jar)
  $ ant
  $ java -cp './lib/*.jar:./dist/lib/*.jar' \
         com.jcraft.jcterm.JCTermSwingFrame

If you need the packet compression support, you have to put the jar file of 
jzlib(http://www.jcraft.com/jzlib) into lib/ .


Using ssh-agent
===============
JCTerm supports OpenSSH's ssh-agent and Putty's pageant by
using jsch-agent-proxy.  Here are steps to enable it,

  $ pushd /tmp
  $ git clone git://github.com/ymnk/jsch-agent-proxy.git
  $ cd jsch-agent-proxy
  $ mkdir lib
  $ (cd lib; \
     wget --no-check-certificate \
          https://github.com/downloads/twall/jna/jna.jar)
  $ (cd lib; \
     wget --no-check-certificate \
          https://github.com/downloads/twall/jna/platform.jar)
  $ (cd lib; \
     wget \
          http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsch/files/jsch.jar/0.1.48/jsch-0.1.48.jar)
  $ ant
  $ popd
  $ mkdir lib/
  $ cp /tmp/jsch-agent-proxy/lib/*.jar lib/
  $ cp /tmp/jsch-agent-proxy/jsch-agent-proxy/dist/lib/*.jar lib/
  $ ant
  $ java -cp './lib/*.jar:./dist/lib/*.jar' \
         -Djcterm.config.use_ssh_agent=true \
         com.jcraft.jcterm.JCTermSwingFrame


On-Line Demo
============
On-Line demo is available at http://wiredx.net/jcterm/ .
On this page, the digitally signed JCterm applet is provided and
you can try JCterm on the web browser.  In starting this applet,
you will receive a Java Security prompt asking to deny/grant to run it.


JCTerm for J2ME/CDC platform
============================
JCTermJ2MECDC is the port of JCTerm to J2ME/CDC platform.

  How to Compile
  ==============
  To compile this program, you need BouncyCastle Crypto API
  (http://www.bouncycastle.org/) 1.26 or later and JSch for 
  J2ME/CDC, which is available at http://j2me.jsch.org/ .  

  Confirmed Devices
  =================
  We have heard that this program is running on the following device.
    * SHARP Zaurus SL-C700
      The binary for this device is available at http://j2me.jsch.org/ .
    * SHARP Zaurus SL-C760


JCTerm for J2ME/CLDC/MIDP2.0
============================
JCTermMIDP is the port of JCTerm to J2ME/CLDC/MIDP2.0 platform.

  How to Compile
  ==============
  To compile this midlet, you need BouncyCastle Crypto API
  (http://www.bouncycastle.org/) 1.26 or later and JSch for 
  J2ME/CLDC/MIDP2.0, which is available at http://j2me.jsch.org/ .  
  We have confirmed that this midlet is compilable on Sun's Wireless 
  Toolkit 2.2. You have to delete following files before compilation process,
    * src/com/jcraft/jcterm/JCTerm.java
    * src/com/jcraft/jcterm/JCTermAWT.java
    * src/com/jcraft/jcterm/JCTermApplet.java
    * src/com/jcraft/jcterm/JCTermJ2MECDC.java
    * src/com/jcraft/jcterm/Sftp.java
    * src/com/jcraft/jcterm/Splash.java
  The jar and jad files are available at http://j2me.jsch.org/ .

  Public-key Authentication
  =========================
  Current version supports password authentication and public-key 
  authentication.  This midlet will allow you to install private keys 
  into MIDP's RecordStore.  After staring this midlet, you will find 
  the checkbox 'Install private key',  If you select this checkbox and 
  connect to the remote host with password authentication , following commands
    'cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa' and 'cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa'
  will be remotely execed and outputs will be stored locally.
  In the next time, public-key authentication will be tried.
  Of course, we strongly recommend to encrypt id_rsa' and 'id_dsa'.

  Confirmed Devices
  =================
  We have heard that this midlet is running on the following device.
    * Motorola c650


TODO
