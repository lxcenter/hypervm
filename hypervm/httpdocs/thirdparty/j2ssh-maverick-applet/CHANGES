------------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.51 - Mar 31, 2014

Features
    o Added acceptLocalForwarding method to ForwardingClientListener.

Bug Fixes
    o Potential memory leak fixed when using pooled SftpClients with non-pooled SftpClient instances.
    o Subsequent call to ForwardingClient.stopLocalForwarding with a key that had previously been used to stop listening but not kill active tunnels should kill any remaining tunnels if the killActiveTunnels flag is true.
    o Changed default cipher to aes128-ctr.
    o Added back processStandardData protected method of byte[],int,int to prevent backwards compatibility issues.
    o Socket timeout applied via use of Ssh2Context.setSocketTimeout is not applied until after identification exchange.

-------------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.50 - Nov 20, 2013

	o Made SftpClient.matchRemoteFiles method public to allow wildcard searches to be performed on remote directory.
	o SftpFileInputStream calls getAttributes on file but its no longer needed.
	o umask not being applied to default file permissions when put through SftpClient.
	
-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.49 - Oct 5, 2013

Bug Fixes

Bug Fixes
    o Ssh2Channel checkCloseStatus call in close method does not pass correct remote closure state causing potential lockup in close method.
    
------------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.47 - July 5, 2013

Features
    o Added SshConnector.enableFIPSMode to configure the client to only use FIPS supported algorithms. This requires a JCE that supports 2048 bit DH primes so is incompatible with SunJCE, use BouncyCastle JCE to support this or a FIPS certified JCE.
    
Bug Fixes
    o When no default JCE provider is specified on JCEComponentManager, for diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 only, default to BouncyCastle JCE if it is an installed Provider. 
    o AbstractJCECipher IV is now initialized with getBlockSize, allowing it to be overridden to prevent NPE with NSS/JSS crypto.
    o Erroneous inclusion of Jakarta ORO .class files in maverick-all.jar. Use dependency if you need to depend on Jakarta ORO (regex matching in ScpClient/SftpClient).
    o SftpFileInputStream does not implement available causing issues with GZIPInputStream and BufferedInputStream.
    
-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.46 - Apr 26, 2013

Bug Fixes

    o Attempts to read non-existent data from SFTP v4 file attributes ACL.
    
-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.45 - Mar 13, 2013

    o Forwarding client bottleneck fix in local forwarding socket listener.
    o Better handling of channel EOF messages, forcing channel close when both sides are EOF.
    o Channel is now freed only after all listener events have been fired.
    o Debug mode now logs command input/output in log.
    o SftpClient fails to throw SftpStatusException on put when server returns SSH_FXP_STATUS other than SSH_FX_OK in response to SSH_FXP_CLOSE message.
    o License verification made less sensitive to whitespace changes.
    o Removed use of circular buffer in Ssh2Channel to provide more flexible support for larger window sizes.
    o OpenSSHPublicKeyFile performs unnecessary check against key algorithm name preventing further supported types being used.
    o GlobRegExpMatching fails to process match if file is a directory.
    o SSH1 RSA private keys fails to authenticate with 'unknown block type' or 'Data must start with zero' exception.
    
----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.44 - Dec 5, 2012

Bug Fixes
    o ScpClient creates file before parsing entire response; in the event response is incorrect create file after complete parsing of response.
    o AbstractKnownHostsKeyVerification fails to process known_hosts ` line with multiple host names for public key.

-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.43 - Oct 12, 2012
    
Bug Fixes
    o Text mode file transfer incorrectly defaults to processing all EOL types and not just system EOL types.
    o SftpClient block and maximum packet settings brought into line with other implementations as our larger (but still technically within protocol limits) were causing problems with some servers.  
   
-----------------

    o Race condition causes short lived channel to remain open if server closes before client has updated channel from uninitialized to open.
    o Zero length channel data packet causes EOF exception when channel int read() is used to return data from channel InputStream.
    o AbstractKnownHostsKeyVerification requires synchronization to ensure thread safety.
  
------------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.39 - June 28, 2012

Features
    o Added system property maverick.debug.dsa.rvalue to allow output of DSA r value received from server in host key verification

    o copyRemoteDirectory incorrectly copies all files to base directory.
    o OpenSSH cannot read private keys encrypted by API.
    o AbstractKnownHostsKeyVerification chokes on invalid host key entry, invalid hosts are now ignored by default and delegated to subclass in onInvalidHostEntry function. ConsoleKnownHostsKeyVerification now outputs the line as a warning but does not fail.
    o rsa1 key is incorrectly encoded by JCEComponentManager in knownhosts file.      

-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.34 - Sept 25, 2011

    o ScpClient issue with Windows path separator fixed.
    
------------------


J2SSH Maverick 1.4.29 - September 16, 2010
    
Bug Fixes
    o Race condition in key exchange allows client to send message out of sequence, before messages that have been queued during key exchange.
    o Synchronization of Ssh2Channel.sendRequest causes deadlock when command execution request fails on Maverick SSHD server. 
    
------------------

Features                       
    o Added missing hmac-md5-96 and hmac-sha1-96 HMACs to JCE provider.
    o Added enableCompression/disableCompression methods to Ssh2Context for easy configuration of zlib compression.

Bug Fixes
    o New socket timeout behaviour causes deadlock when timeout occurs during session channel initialisation. New behaviour is not enabled by default and so this problem will only affect those customers that have enabled the new behaviour.
    o Text mode performance fix fails to flush OutputStream causing small files to be uploaded as zero bytes.
    
------------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.27 - July 14, 2010
    
Bug Fixes                       
    o Text mode transfers suffer from performance problem due to writing single bytes to an unbuffered file.
        
------------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.26 - May 24, 2010

    o Support for zlib@openssh.com compression added.
    
------------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.25 - April 8, 2010
    
Bug Fixes                        
    o SocketTransport.getHost() changed to return the stored hostname value instead of calling
      Socket.getInetAddress().getHostName(). This call could initiate DNS calls that can
      cause connection startup delays after a connection has been made due to it's use in 
      logging statements.
      
-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.24 - March 26, 2010

Features
    o Added option to Ssh2Context to support socket timeouts and idle events through TransportProtocolListener
      this includes an option to send SSH_MSG_IGNORE packet on idle as well as disconnect on idle connection timeout.
    
Bug Fixes                        
    o Fixed source code compile for Enterprise license.
    o Added getModifiedDateTime/getCreationDateTime/getAccessedDateTime methods to return SftpFileAttributes times
      as a java.util.Date object.
    o Changed SftpClient internal calls to return attributes from getAttributes rather than stat to prevent
      multiple calls to resolveRemotePath().
    o Use of OPEN_EXCL flag in put() method and getOutputStream() removed in favour of OPEN_TRUNCATE due to problems
      with some servers handling OPEN_EXCL incorrectly. 
    o SftpClient.get() should perform stat prior to creating local file. 
    
-------------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.23 - February 12, 2010

Bug Fixes
    o Added timeout to ThreadSyncronizer wait() call due to potential lockup issue.
    o API cannot handle remote window space larger than 2^31 due to signed int conversion.

    o SSH2 channel open hangs under load when older closed channel with same id attempts to 
      free itself again.
    o Changed get() calls to return attributes from getAttributes rather than stat to prevent
      multiple calls to resolveRemotePath().
    o JCE provider RSA encoding problem causes SSH1 connections to randomly fail.  
    
-------------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.22 - December 30, 2009

Bug Fixes
    o ScpClient put() incorrectly appends full absolute path to file's parent path.

      Diffie Hellman key exchange could generate and use algorithm values that do not
      conform to key exchange specification. 

-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.19 - November 6, 2009
    
Bug Fixes
    o Fixed copyLocalDirectory, copyRemoteDirectory behaviour to copy contents
      of folder into specified directory rather than placing new directory with
      contents into specified directory.
    o 3des CTR mode incorrectly reported itself as CBC mode
    o SFTP read fails after one block of data when server incorrectly reports a file 
      as having zero length in a stat request.

      not to work. 
      
------------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.14 - June 16, 2009
    
Bug Fixes
    o ComponentFactory list method not synchronized causing ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
      exception if algorithm order changed whilst method is invoked. 
      
------------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.13 - June 9, 2009
    
Bug Fixes
    o Fixed SftpFileInputStream read() method, returned int masked with 0x000000FF 
      to return correct integer value. Problem can previously be seen when using
      GZIPInputStream to uncompress file loaded with SFTPFileInputStream.
      
Features
    o Added useful methods to SshPrivateKeyFileFactory and SshPublicKeyFileFactory 
      to create a file directly from key objects and convert between file formats.
      
-------------------   
      
J2SSH Maverick 1.4.12 - May 28, 2009

Bug Fixes
    o Fixed EOFException when extracting attributes from mySecureShell server.  
    
-------------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.8 - April 17, 2009
    
Features
    o Added new session init process object to Shell class that allows expect and input
      operations on the session before the session sits at the prompt. This would 
      typically be used to enter additional authentication information when a shell
      initializes.
    o Added arcfour, arcfour128 and arcfour256 ciphers to JCE provider. 
    o Added new constructor to SftpClient for initialization from existing SshSession object.

-------------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.7 - February 14, 2009
    
Bug Fixes
    o KBIRequestHandler showPrompts method changed to return boolean value. Implementations 
      should return true to indicate prompts have been answered, or false to indicate that
      the user has cancelled the authentication attempt. 
    o X509 public key implementation fails signature validation due to incorrect algorithm
      name in public key blob. 
    o Adding algorithm implementations to context when not using per instance algorithm mode causes
      multiple instances of same algorithm to be reported in key exchange. This causes long running
      applications to degrade connection performance and eventually causes new connections to fail
      with ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception.
      
-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.6 - January 7, 2009
    
Bug Fixes
    o Serv-U FTP server returns blank string for FXP_REALNAME on default directory causing 
      subsequent attributes request to fail with "Bad Message" error.
    o Added tests for guessed key exchange first packet in some key exchange implementations.
        
-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.5 - December 12, 2008

Features
    o System property maverick.knownHosts.enableReverseDNS added to allow user to 
      disable reverse DNS lookup in AbstractKnownHostsKeyVerification.
    
Bug Fixes
    o HttpProxyTransport.connectViaProxy method causes stack overflow error.
    o Corrected change made to SftpClient rename which fails with file exists status
      when new path parameter is a directory. The previous change caused the method 
      to act differently than previous versions which allowed the file to be moved 
      from one directory to another. 
    o ScpClient.put throws NullPointerException when local path is absolute.
    o ScpClient fails with unexpected termination exception after successful file transfer
    o SSH v1 connections fail under JCE when BouncyCastle provider is not available on the 
      classpath. BC provider is now added automatically, to disable set 
      maverick.enableBCProvider=false. 
	o X509 not automatically supported when running JCE cryptography provider.
	
-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.4 - October 12, 2008

Bug Fixes
    o Fixed logging ClassCastException when parameter not a string
    
--------------------------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.2 - July 29, 2008

Features
    o AbstractComponentFactory: implemented createInstance so it is not abstract anymore
    o AbstractComponentFactory: class is not abstract anymore
    o AbstractComponentFactory: renamed to ComponentFactory 
    o ComponentManager: init() no longer overrides the createInstance() methods of each of the factories
    o ComponentManager: added static setPerContextAlgorithmPreferences() and getPerContextAlgorithmPreferences methods.
    o Ssh2Context: constructor no longer overrides createInstance when creating the compression factories.
    o TransportProtocol: moved the if(!name.equals(COMPRESSION_NONE)) from the Ssh2Context constructor to the performKeyExchange(byte[]) method so that the condition is checked once instead of twice. 
    o Ssh2Context: now supports per instance algorithm preferences.
    o Provided additional method to pass optional headers through to HTTP proxy.  
    
Bug Fixes
    o ScpClient get() and put() fails to process filenames with / correctly. 
    o HTTP proxy headers now maintain their case correctly. 
    o Server reporting version 2.99 will cause protocol version error.  

-----------------------------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.1 - July 09, 2008

Features
	o ComponentManager: changed to catch SecurityException on call to System.getProperty().
	o StandaloneComponentManager: Added aes128-ctr, aes192-ctr, aes256-ctr ciphers.
	o DiffieHellmanGroup1Sha1 and DiffieHellmanGroup14Sha1: have been tweaked to improve performance.
	o DiffieHellmanGroup14Sha1: Added now that there is better code safety to prevent seemingly random errors when JCE'S are used that do not support it.
	o JCEComponentManager: now tests each of the keyexchange algorithms before adding them to the list of supported algorithms, if the jce does not support the algorithm or the keysize it will not be added.	
	o OpenSSHPublicKeyFile: this class is now public.
	o ScpClient: now implements Client like the other services.
	o SECSHPublicKeyFile: this class is now public.
	o SshConnector: Changed addEventListener and removeEventListener methods to take a String threadPrefix parameter that allows listeners to be registered that will only listen to threads who's name starts with this string.
	o SshMessageRouter: If the thread that creates the message pump thread has a "prefix-" the message pump thread name is now prefixed with the this prefix, to allow per Ssh connection instance logging.
	o SftpSubsystemChannel: removed unused "longname" variable from the extractFiles(SftpMessage, String) method
	o SftpSubsystemChannel: new constructor that allows the maximum sftp version to use to be specified SftpSubsystemChannel(SshSession session, int Max_Version)
	o SftpSubsystemChannel: can now set the maximum sftp version to use on a per instance basis using the instance method setThisMaxSftpVersion(int MAX_VERSION)
	o SftpClient: new constructor that allows the maximum sftp version to use to be specified SftpClient(SshClient ssh, int Max_Version)
	o Ssh2Channel: now has a sendExtendedChannelData() method that allows non protocol messages to be sent over a channel.
	o changed ForwardingClient, AbstractKnownHostsKeyVerification, ScpClient, SftpClient, ComponentManager to catch SecurityException on calls to System.getProperty and to use "" instead of the expected value.

Bug Fixes
	o ComponentManager: removed duplicated cipher and public key factory instantiations.
	o Jars: Fixed problem with manifests that prevented them from being verified once signed using "jarsigner".
	o J2SSHEventCodes: fixed conflicting event ids.
	o IOStreamConnector: now uses the new event logging system
	o SelectorThread: fixed closeAllChannels() so that it cleans up properly
	o SftpFile: removed rename() method as it is not compatible with our sshd, as the sshd will have a file handle open and the rename message uses path not handle. (rename method fixed as it didn't work, then commented out).
	o SftpClient: mkdir(String dir) now throws exception if a file with the name "dir" already exists, previously it would be overwritten.
	o SftpClient: matchRemoteFiles now resolves paths correctly when no regular expression matching is used.
	o SftpSubsystem: fixed file handle leak in onSubsystemFree().

-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.4.0 - May 08, 2008

Features
	o  Logging: All logging has been changed to use an event model.  Important events have their own event codes, less important events are wrapped using EventLog and use the "log event" code or the "debug" event code.
	o  Logging: org.apache.log4j.BasicConfigurator.configure(); should still be used to configure log4j, but it is now only used in the LoggingListener an example implementation is provided "J2SSHLoggingListener".  The LoggingListener used should be set using SshConnector.addEventListener(new J2SSHLoggingListener());.
	o  SshConnector: Added addEventListener and removeEventListener methods for use with the new logging event model.
	o  AbstractComponentFactory: Recoded so that algorithm lists can be fully ordered, there is now a new changePositionofAlgorithm method which facilitates this.
	o  AES192CBC and AES256CBC ciphers added.
	o  ComponentManager: Recoded so that ciphers and MACs can have independent preferences for Server->Client and Client->Server communications.
	o  ComponentManager: now tries JCE first if the "com.sshtools.ssh.components.ComponentManager.tryStandaloneCryptographyBeforeJCE" system property is set to false otherwise Standalone is tried first, this allows the choice to use JCE or Standalone cryptography to be made programatically instead of by changing the classpath or creating a class loader.
	o  DiffieHellmanGroup14Sha1: Removed until better code safety is added in version 1.4.1 to prevent seemingly random errors when JCE'S are used that do not support it.
	o  SftpClient, SshClient, Ssh2Client, Shell, ForwardingClient, now implement a new Client interface giving them all an exit() method with the same name.
	o  Ssh1Client: Added exit method.
	o  Added more logging to various classes.

Bug Fixes
	o  ForwardingClient: Wrapped com.sshtools.net.ForwardingClient.addListener(ForwardingClientListener listener) in an if(listener!=null)  {..} block.
	o  ShellEnvironment: moved session.close();  statements so that it does not close already closed sessions.
	o  ShellEnvironment: fixed so that when it detects 'cygwin' SSHD servers running on windows boxes it sets osDescription, previously only set osType.
	o  Ssh2RsaPublicKey: Fixed com.sshtools.ssh.components.standalone.Ssh2RsaPublicKey equals method so that it is compatible with jce.Ssh2RsaPublicKey.
	o  Ssh2Client: Removed an unused password variable in Ssh2Client.
	o  ByteArrayReader: fixed com.sshtools.util.ByteArrayReader.readShort(byte[], int), it was treating the byte[] as having the 0 index byte as the least significant instead of the most significant byte.
	o  IOStreamConnector: com.sshtools.util.IOStreamConnector.close() now sets the connectors state to closed even if it has not been started.
	o  SftpClient: com.sshtools.sftp.SftpClient.rename() now doesn't attempt to rename to an existing filename.
	o  AbstractComponentFactory: made AbstractComponentFactory's add,remove,clear methods synchronised.
	o  SshMessageRouter: com.sshtools.ssh.message.SshMessageRouter.start() now only starts the messagepump if it has not already been started.
	o  Fixed the word occurred which was misspelt as occured.
	o  When the server required no authentication and therefore had no authentication methods, the message pump on buffered sessions was not started if authenticate() was not called.
	o  fixed an scp absolute path problem
	o  updated obfuscation software to fix preverification errors

-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.3.10 - November 14, 2007

Features
	o  Added getHost() method to AuthenticationProtocol which returns the host the underlying transport protocol has connected to
	o  Added sendMessage() method to AuthenticationProtocol which sends a transport message.
	o  Added getProvider() method to TransportProtocol which returns the underlying SshTransport
	o  Added com.sshtools.ssh2.TransportProtocol.getContext() method that returns the current SshContext.
	o  Added com.sshtools.ssh2.GSSCallback class.
	o  Prepended "MessagePump" onto message pump thread name.
	o  Refactored build file.
	o  Added more debug information for when SshConnector fails to initialize Ssh2.
	o  Cleaned ComponentManager.init so that it does not initialize components twice
	o  Added getKeyExchange() method that returns the SshKeyExchangeClient in use to TransportProtocol
	o  Added getKeyExchange() method that returns the SshKeyExchangeClient in use to AuthenticationProtocol
	o  Added getKeyExchangeInstanceInUse() method that returns the SshKeyExchangeClient in use to Ssh2Client
	o  Made AuthenticationResult public
	o  Added listFiles() method to SftpClient as File.listFiles is not 1.1 compatible
	o  Added getIgnoreHostKeyifEmpty() and setIgnoreHostKeyifEmpty() methods to TransportProtocol,
	    when the ignoreHostKeyifEmpty is set to true performKeyExchange does not do any HostKeyVerification.
	o  Added Arrayequals method to transport protocol from Java 1.2 to make keep 1.1. compatibility

Bug Fixes
	o  Fixed com.sshtools.util.IOStreamConnector.setBufferSize() so that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown for invalid sizes rather than valid sizes
	o  Fixed synchronization issue in com.sshtools.ssh.components.ComponentManager.getInstance() so that 
	    if first call to getInstance is made simultaneously by 2 threads it is only initialized once by making the second thread wait till the first has initialized it. 
	o  Fixed bug in com.sshtools.ssh2.Ssh2Channel.processChannelMessage(SshChannelMessage) where 
	    SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_CLOSE messages were being consumed once processed rather than passing back up the call chain.
	o  Fixed some 1.1 compatibility problems.

-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.3.9 - September 19, 2007

Features

		so that it no longer attempts to close a channel twice.

-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.3.8 - September 3, 2007

Features
	o  Option added to Shell implementation to pre-configure the remote operating system type to prevent auto-detection.
	o  Added hassize(), hasuid(), hasgid() methods to com.sshtools.sftp.SftpFileAttributes

Bug Fixes
	o  Removed unused private transferFile() method from SftpClient
	o  Perl5RegExpMatching always threw ClassCastException
	o  Changed com.sshtools.ssh.components.AbstractComponentFactory.createDelimitedList(String preferred, Enumeration names) 
		so that if the preferred component is not contained within the enumeration, it is not prepended to the list.
	o  Made Shell.setPromptTimeoutPeriod synchronized
	o  Various low level code optimizations
	o  Various code safety improvements.
	o  ShellEnvironment fixed so that it detects 'cygwin' SSHD servers running on windows boxes
	o  SftpSubsystemChannel.performOptimizedRead optimized for files smaller than the block size.
	o  Tweaked order of code in SftpClient.get() so that local files are processed before remote files, this reduces server load, 
    		in cases where either exceptions are thrown or the api is used badly.
	o  ScpClient where relative paths were processed incorrectly
	o  com.sshtools.ssh.CommandExecutor is now deprecated, the shell class should be used instead.
	o  ScpClient.putFiles fixes.
    
-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.3.7 - July 5, 2007

Features

-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.3.5 - June 18, 2007

Features
    o  The Ssh2Client now authenticates using KBI when password authentication is not available.
    o  The SftpClient now has "getFiles" and "putFiles" methods that allow the use of regular expressions to copy multiple files.
    o  The resume features should not be used simultaneously with the a regular expression that matches more than one file.
    o  The ScpClient 'put' methods now allow the use of regular expressions to copy multiple files.
    o  The resume features should not be used simultaneously with the a regular expression that matches more than one file.

-----------------
    
J2SSH Maverick 1.3.3 - March 27, 2007

Bug Fixes
    o  Option to turn off pseudo terminal allocation in Shell class. This was required for 
       correct identification of VShell servers. 
    o  SftpFileInputStream uses SSH_FXP_FSTAT message for open files. Whilst this is not a 
       problem for most SFTP servers the FreeFTPD server, for unknown reasons does not support 
       this operation so prevents access using the API when attempting to use InputStream based 
       code against this server implementation. Changed SftpFileInputStream to use SSH_FXP_STAT 
       message to prevent this error.
    o  SftpClient fails to release file handle for text mode files. 
    o  SftpFile processes both \ and / as file separators causing problems with filenames that
       contain \ as a valid character.

-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.3.2 - Febuary 20, 2007

Features
    o  Option to disable key re-exchange.       
       
Bug Fixes
    o  SftpClient put to hidden files on Windows port of OpenSSH does not truncate file.
    
-----------------
IMPORTANT NOTICE: 

This version of J2SSH Maverick may not be compatible with source code developed using previous 
versions of the API. Changes have been required to some package structures to enable the 
cryptographic provider to be completely seperated from the API. These changes now allow us
to provide seperate implementations of the API for the internal cryptographic provider and 
the Java Cryptography Extensions provider. 

J2SSH Maverick 1.3.0 - January 31, 2007

Features
    o  API can now be used exclusively with the Java Runtime JCE provider, or alternatively
       the internal provider. Simply select the maverick-jce-only.jar file if you want to use
       the JCE exclusively, or maverick-standalone-only.jar if you want to use the internal
       provider. The maverick-all.jar contains all implementations and will default to the
       internal provider. 

-----------------
       
J2SSH Maverick 1.2.12 - November 12, 2006

Features
    o  Additional method added to SshConnector to allow SSH identification software/version/comments field
       to be replaced by a custom value. 

Bug Fixes
    o  SSH identification string from OpenSSH server with trailing space character ' ' causes
       Invalid Host Key Signature exception.
    o  Shell exit method fails to close session channel if exit command fails. 
    o  Public key authentication fails when using JCE versions of public key objects.
    o  Server failing to respond to MSG_SSH_CHANNEL_CLOSE causes API to lockup.
    o  Inconsistent SshException reason code returned when remote side terminates connection.

-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.2.11 - September 18, 2006

Features
    o  hmac-md5-96 and hmac-sha1-96 Message Authentication Code algorithms added
    o  Support for x509v3-sign-rsa and x509v3-sign-rsa-sha1 certificates 
    o  Added methods to SshConnector to return current product version and release date.
    o  Added diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 key exchange as per SSH Transport Protocol specification. This 
       implementation exists in both the internal crypto provider and JCE formats although it should be
       noted that the default SUN reference JCE provider does not support 2048 bit primes required by
       this key exchange method. The BouncyCastle JCE provider (www.bouncycastle.org) does and has been
       used to test this algorithm works with JCE enabled.
    o  Support for SSH1 challenge response authentication added.

Bug Fixes
    o  API now passes all SSHredder vulnerability checks (http://www.rapid7.com/info/sshredder.html)
    o  Added partial message timeout setting to Ssh2Context in response to a number of vulnerabilties
       identified by SSHredder. This timeout only applies once a message is received, and determines how
       long the remote server has to send the remaining bytes of the message before a timeout exception is
       thrown. This prevents the client locking up when the server does not send all of the data it declared
       in the message header.
    o  Shell class hangs on createSession due to prompt command being sent too quickly.
    o  Timeout setting added to Shell class so that it does not get stuck waiting for a prompt that never arrives.
    o  Initialization period setting added to Shell class to allow the shell to initialize correctly over a configurable period.
    o  FileTransferProgress reports total transfer length of 0 for ASCII file transfers. 

-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.2.10 - July 22, 2006

Bug Fixes
    o  Shell class hangs when connecting to FreeSSHD Windows server. Whilst the actual problem seems to be a bug in 
       the server implementation several workarounds have been added to the Shell class (see javadocs for further info).

-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.2.9 - June 8, 2006

Bug Fixes
    o  SCP time command is now ignored rather than throwing an exception to allow files to still be received
       from servers sending a time command.
    o  UTF-8 license encoding now supported.

-----------------

J2SSH Maverick 1.2.8 - May 3, 2006

Bug Fixes
    o  SftpFile getParent fix from 1.2.7 causes "No such file" error with filesystem root /
    o  Exceptions caught by a subsystem was not being propagated correctly resulting in bad error messages.

-----------------

Features
    o  FileTransferProgress interface can now be passed into the ScpClient methods to enable a transfer to be
       tracked or cancelled.
    o  Support for socket timeouts. Setting a timeout on the socket will now result in a non-fatal exception with 
       a reason code of SOCKET_TIMEOUT. 
    o  Simple CommandExecutor class added to allow multiple commands to be executed with a session. (Requires knowledge
       of prompt format)
    o  Additional executeCommand method added to SshSession interface to allow charset to be defined for the command.

Bug Fixes
    o  Shell class fails when remote environment cannot be determined, this has been changed to allow default behaviour.
    o  SftpInputStream read() method always returns 1
    o  SftpFile getParent method could return itself as the parent if path ends with /
    o  AbstractKnownHostsKeyVerification fails to consult temporary keys before permanent keys causing host verification errors
    o  Forwarding client could return tunnels that no longer exist.

-----------------
J2SSH Maverick 1.2.6 - October 13, 2005

Bug Fixes
    o  Directory operation methods would always report new file as an update file.
    o  Directory operation remote copy always fetched unchanged files causing corruption of progress tracking.
    o  Transport protocol failed to set maximum packet size to value configured in SshContext.
    o  In some circumstances the ByteArrayReader could return an incorrect value for unsigned int causing very 
       rare miscellaneous errors.

Bug Fixes
    o  SftpInputStream and SftpOutputStream now perform optimized transfers providing similar performance to the
       SftpClient's get and put methods.
    o  stopLocalForwarding & cancelRemoteForwarding methods throw NPE when attempt is made to stop an invalid 
       forwarding configuration
    o  The maximum supported transport protocol packet was 35,000 bytes, this caused problems with Globalscape server which
       sends packets larger than the recommended size. The API will now adapt to such errors by increasing the maximum packet
       size when required. The limit forcing a protocol exception can now be set in the Ssh2Context setMaximumPacketLength 
       method which defaults to 131072 bytes.
    o  ANT task removed from distribution, use the free ANT download if required.
    o  SshKeyPairGenerator class algorithm naming inconsistency removed.
    o  AbstractKnownHostsKeyVerification and public key factories throw OutOfMemoryError when parsing a corrupted file.
